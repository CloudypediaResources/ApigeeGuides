## Introduction
Governance is key to almost every successful initiative, regardless of it being technology-related or not.
After all, the results of any effort are as good as the decisions that had been made along the way.
We have taken key decisions and adopted a level of controls that govern the API lifecycle including inception, design, implementation, operation, and measurement.
This aims to enforce a lightweight governance while encouraging innovation and collaboration across the team and keeps the door open for optimization.
