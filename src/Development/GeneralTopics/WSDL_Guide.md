## Introduction

This guide will help you understand how to read and interpret WSDL files. WSDL files are an essential part of web
services and API development and knowing how to read them is critical for API integration engineers.

## What is a WSDL file?

WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is an XML-based language used to describe the functionality of web services. A
WSDL file defines the operations, input, and output parameters, and other necessary information about a web service
required for creating web service clients. It helps in the communication between different systems irrespective of the
programming languages or platforms used on the client and server sides.

## WSDL Structure and Components

A typical WSDL file consists of the following main elements:

1. **Definitions**: Root element of the WSDL file that contains basic information about the web service like the target
   namespace, available message types, and port types.

2. **Types**: Define the data types used for input and output messages in the web service. This element uses the XML
   Schema Language to declare complex and simple data types.

3. **Message**: Represents the input and output parameters for each operation in the web service. Each `message` element
   encapsulates the data that is sent or received during an operation.

4. **PortType**: Declares a collection of abstract operations exposed by the web service. These operations are defined
   using input and output messages along with their respective message types.

5. **Binding**: Binds the defined operations to a specific protocol (e.g., SOAP, HTTP, MIME) and defines how messages
   are exchanged. This includes specifying elements like transport protocol, style, and encoding.

6. **Service**: Defines a web service by specifying the `port` and `binding` information. It's the endpoint where the
   web service is exposed and accessed.

## How to Read and Interpret a WSDL File

> The easiest way to read a WSDL file is to use a WSDL viewer. There are many free WSDL viewers available online that
> can help you visualize the structure and components of a WSDL file like soapUI,
> But if you prefer to read and interpret the WSDL file manually, you can follow these steps:

1. Examine the `Schema` tag under the `Types` tag for:
    - an element name cloud be the name of the operation request
    - an element name cloud be the name of the operation response usually with the word "Response" at the end
    - an element name cloud be the name of the operation fault usually with the word "Fault" or "Error" at the end
2. Follow each element to get the structure of the request, response, and fault, that maybe mapped on nested elements or
   referenced to other elements through `type` attribute.

If you did not reach to this info you will have to do it manually strating from the service tag:

1. Examine the `service` tag to get the port name.
2. Examine the `port` tag to get the `operation` tags
3. Examine the `operation` tag to get the `input`, `output` and `fault` tags
4. Examine the `input`, `output` and `fault` tags to get the names of those `message` tags
5. Examine the `message` tags to get the `part` tags that contains the name of the element that you are looking for.

- **input message element:** is the request message that the client sends to the server.
- **output message element:** is the response message that the server sends to the client.
- **fault message element:** is the error message that the server sends to the client.

By following these steps, you should be able to read and interpret WSDL files effectively.

## Some Tips

1. Tags
    - "complexType" is equal to Swagger's object, organizing related properties for easier management.

2. Attributes
    - "minOccurs" signifies required fields in Swagger .
    - "maxOccurs=unbounded" corresponds to arrays in Swagger.
    - "type" in WSDL is equivalent to "ref" in Swagger, allowing for the reuse of data types.

3. Elements
    - "sequence" is used to define the order of elements in a complex type.
    - "choice" is used to define a choice between elements in a complex type.
    - "name" is used to define the name of an element or attribute.
    - "type" is used to define the data type of element or attribute or refer to complex type.
        - name come from the element attribute name not the name on the reference element.
